        <bdtitle>About The Future was Flash and IPX Forever</bdtitle><br><br>
        TFWF and IPXF were started as personal project mostly to create an SWF archive for myself. It has been a lot of learning as I go and while it has been frustrating at times, I think it has turned out well, or at least good enough for me. I decided after the site was stable enough to make it public. That said, I hope you enjoy using it as much as I <strike>enjoyed</strike> enjoy making it.
        <br><br><bdtitle>The Road Ahead</bdtitle><br><br>
        I intend to keep adding games and improving the site as long as I can. As always you can <a href="https://forms.gle/aKQ3MnfkNq4jJahCA">suggest new games</a> to be added.
